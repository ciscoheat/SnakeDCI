# SnakeDCI

This repository is a supplement to the [haxedci](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxedci) Haxe library. It shows the power of DCI in a larger example than the basic [Money Transfer](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxedci-example), by creating the classic Snake game in Haxe using DCI and the Haxeflixel game library.

## How to use
Clone this repository or download it, then open the [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) project file, or execute run.bat to build and run.

You need to execute the following haxelib commands in a command prompt to run SnakeDCI:

**haxelib install haxedci** <br>
**haxelib install flixel**

## What is DCI?
DCI stands for Data, Context, Interaction. One of the key aspects of DCI is to separate what a system *is* (data) from what it *does* (function). Data and function has very different rates of change so they should be separated, not as it currently is, put in classes together. But DCI is so much more, so please explore the resources below. If you are familiar with [Haxe](http://haxe.org), the [haxedci-example](https://github.com/ciscoheat/haxedci-example) is a good start.
